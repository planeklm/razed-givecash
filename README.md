**Hello FiveM community!üëã**\
We have created a simple cash give script for qbcore framework which has options for both QB and OX.
You use your 3rd-eye (qb-target default) to interact with a player to open the UI.

**Features:**

* Fully Open-Source
* OX and QB
* Customizable
* Easy to configure

# How To Install
* Drag and drop `razed-cashgive`
* In your `server.cfg` add `ensure razed-cashgive`
